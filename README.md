## About Me

As a cybersecurity-focused B.E. Computer Science student at KPR Institute of Engineering and Technology,
Coimbatore, I possess a strong command over Networking, Ethical Hacking, Penetration testing, and Linux.
Actively engaged in hackathons and CTF challenges, I continually hone my skills to tackle evolving cyber
threats. <br/>
My journey includes immersive training at NXT Wave 4.0 Academy, where I mastered full-stack development,
further enriching my skill set and versatility. I've demonstrated my expertise by delivering
numerous projects to satisfied clients through freelancing platforms.
As a dedicated security researcher, I remain vigilant, keeping abreast of daily security incidents and emerging
trends. My proactive approachextends to bug hunting, where I've successfully reported critical vulnerabilities through bug bounty programs
and independently discovered flaws across various platforms. <br/>

I am poised and enthusiastic to take on new challenges in the dynamic realm of cybersecurity and
full-stack development, where my expertise and passion converge to make a significant impact.
